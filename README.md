# Active Noise Cancelling

## Overview
The **Active Noise Cancelling** project is a Python-based application that processes live audio input to remove background noise. This project uses advanced signal processing algorithms to filter out unwanted noise in real-time, making it ideal for use in remote communication, video conferences, and other noisy environments.

## Features
- **Real-time audio processing**: Works by continuously capturing sound from your microphone and removing background noise in real time.
- **Noise reduction algorithms**: Utilizes advanced signal processing techniques to improve audio clarity.
- **Audio output**: Outputs the processed audio with reduced noise, providing a better listening experience.
- **Lightweight and fast**: Optimized for real-time processing with minimal delay.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pyaudio` for microphone input
- `numpy` and `scipy` for signal processing
- `matplotlib` for audio visualization (optional)

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoheilGtex/Active-Noise-Cancelling.git
